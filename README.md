This is a WordPress theme for the openClassrooms course "Integrating a wordpress theme";
It is created with the [underscores](https://underscores.me/) boilerplate.

This also enabled me to learn the basics of creating a wordpress theme from A to Z.
A big thanks to https://github.com/Alecaddd/WordPress101 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTRZYnYQlmo for the help in understanding the ins and outs of the CMS.
